#EXTRA CREDIT -
#
#You have already printed the cost of various amounts of pizza using
#a loop. Let's suppose that there are now additional bundles available
#with different amounts of pizza. That is:
#
#For every 2 pizzas you buy, you get a free topping
#For every 3 pizzas you buy, you get a free soda
#For every 5 pizzas you buy after the first 10, you get a loyalty reward card
#
#Using a loop, print the cost of buying 0-20 pizzas. Whenever one of the above
#conditions is met, also print the condition. 
#
#No points will be given for printing this sequence manually (otherwise known as
#"hard coding"). You should use only one loop.
