#If a user orders 0 or a negative number of pizzas, print 
#a message telling them that's an invalid order and exit. 
#Otherwise, print the total. Use an if/else. You do not 
#need to print the "free soda" message.
#
#Example output1:
#Enter number of pizzas: -2
#You must order a positive number
#
#Example output2:
#Enter number of pizzas: 8
#Your total is $96
